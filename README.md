# PERSONALIZED YOUTUBE PLAYER
I am currently working on a personalized youtube player after finding the original youtube website very uncomfortable when it comes to making my own playlist and controlling the songs I want to play. This project is under way and is not yet ready. If you are willing to contribute, please give me feedback as it is always appreciated.
